# ParentPLUS-May2022

This repository contains a number of data files and an R Markdown file ("TCF Parent PLUS Analysis.Rmd") that together reproduce the original analysis in The Century Foundation's report "Protected: Parent PLUS Borrowers: The Hidden Casualties of the Student Debt Crisis," released May 31, 2022. This Markdown file is annotated to explain the what the analysis does and why. 

This repository also contains a file that reproduces the report's analysis of data from the Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking ("Parent-Loans-SHED-May2022"). 

All data files needed to reproduce my analysis are either included in this repository or publicly available. The Markdown files indicate where to find online any files that were too large to include in the repository.
