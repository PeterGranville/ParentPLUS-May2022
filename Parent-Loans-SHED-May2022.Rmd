## About the data

The Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) is an annual survey of U.S. adults conducted by the Federal Reserve.[^1] For this analysis, the data releases reflecting surveys conducted in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 were combined, which is necessary to get a large sample of parents who hold student loans for a child's education. The universe of our analysis is parents in the U.S.[^2]

[^1]: The Federal Reserve has also published supplemental releases reflecting surveys conducted in April 2020 and July 2020. They are not integrated into this analysis.

[^2]: Although we would liked to have filtered for parents of children aged 18+, the data are not available to make that filter.

The SHED data releases fill a need for financial information on parents who take out loans, including Parent PLUS loans, to help cover the costs of their child's education.[^3] We cannot tell from the SHED data when the loan held by a parent is a Parent PlUS loan, which means this analysis spans both federal parent-loans and private parent-loans. 

Note, as well, that while Parent PLUS loans are almost never taken out by a grandparent to pay for a grandchild's education, this restriction does not apply to private loans. The SHED questionnaire asks respondents whether they hold student loans for a child's or grandchild's education; as shorthand, this document will use the phrase "loans for a child's education," but the population referenced includes those who hold debt for a grandchild's education. 

The following tables will explore how patterns in parents' need to take out loans in order to pay for a child's education can compound the racial wealth gap and other structural impediments to Black Americans' upward mobility.

[^3]: The data do not distinguish between debt for higher education and debt for K-12 education, unfortunately.

The tables that follow compare eight groups: parents who hold debt for a child's education, split across four racial/ethnic groups (Black, white, Hispanic,[^4] and others[^5]), and adults who do not hold this debt, again distinguishing across the four aforementioned groups.  

[^4]: Anyone who identifies as Hispanic is included in this group, even if they also identify as Black, white, or another race. This appendix uses the term Hispanic, as specified by SHED. Because the Education Department data that comprises the basis for much of the main report uses the term "Latino," the main report cites statistics from this appendix in terms of Latino parent-borrowers. While these groups are not the same, we conform the language in the main report for simplicity and to minimize readers' confusion. 

[^5]: Pulling out more racial/ethnic groups is possible but would likely lead to insufficient sample size for some groups.

Table 1 below provides a summary of the SHED data for our comparison groups.

```{r display1, echo=FALSE}
kable3
```

According to these estimates, about 10.2 million U.S. parents hold student loans for a child's education. According to data from the Federal Student Aid Data Center, there were 3.7 million Parent PLUS loans with outstanding loan balances as of March 31, 2022. Both parents in a two-parent family may claim a loan, which means that, while there are 3.7 million Parent PLUS loans, there are more than 3.7 million Parent PLUS parent-borrowers. If we conservatively estimate that, when asked if they hold student loans for a child's education, both parents would have responded "yes" in at least 80% of Parent PLUS families, then we would have 6.7 million Parent PLUS borrowers. In such case, Parent PLUS borrowers make up around two-thirds of parents with student loans for their child's education, with the remainder holding only private student loans.

Table 2 below shows the percentage of parents within each group that holds debt for a child's education.

```{r lateaddition, echo=FALSE}
kable0
```

## Characteristics of parents who hold student loans for a child's education

This section provides data on the basic characteristics of parents who hold student loans for a child's education.

Table 3 shows a basic breakdown by education attainment.[^7] Almost one-third of Black parents with student loans for a child's education have a high school diploma or less, which is lower than the percentage among Hispanic parents who hold these loans (54 percent) but more than the percentage among white parents and those of other races who hold this debt (26 percent and 17 percent, respectively).

[^7]: More detailed breakdowns by educational attainment are possible; this is the simplest breakdown available.

```{r display6, echo=FALSE}
kable8 # Education level 
```

The figure below shows the age distribution of U.S. parents, filtered for those aged 30+. Among those who hold student loans for a child's education, Hispanic parents tend to be younger, whereas the age distributions of Black parent-borrowers and white parent-borrowers are not very different.

```{r display5, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
gg1 # Age distribution
```

Table 4 below shows that, of those with student loans for a child's education, Black parents are the most likely to be retired, at 33 percent. For many of parent-borrowers, particularly for Black parents with these loans, monthly payments may be coming from Social Security or pension payments.

```{r display4, echo=FALSE}
kable6b # Retirement status
```

The figure below shows the distribution of U.S. parents by income. Compared to white parent-borrowers and those of other races, Black and Hispanic parents with student loans for a child's education are more likely to be low-income, with nearly 4 in 10 having incomes under \$50,000. While this is a lower share than Black and Hispanic parents who do not hold these loans, the differences by race remain stark; the median white parent with student loans for a child's education makes six figures.

```{r display7, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
gg2 # Income 
```

Table 5 below shows that those with student loans for a child's education are more likely to be working, and of these, Black parents with these loans are the most likely to be working four or more jobs.

```{r display3, echo=FALSE}
kable6 # Number of jobs
```

## Parent-held student loans amid other barriers to wealth and financial security

The tables in this section explore how parent-held loans can build on other existing financial challenges, especially for Black parents.

Table 6 below shows that parent-borrowers' total debt for their children's education includes credit card debt more frequently for Black and Hispanic parents than for those of other groups, and it includes home equity loans less frequently for Black parents than for those of other groups. This is concerning given that credit card debt typically has interest rates that are more than triple those of student loans and home equity loans.[^8]

[^8]: According to Investopedia, the median rate of interest for credit cards in 2021 was 19.5 percent. According to ValuePenguin, the average interest rate of a home equity loan is between 5 percent and 6 percent depending on the length of the loan.

```{r display2, echo=FALSE}
kable4
```

Table 7 below indicates that, of parents with student loans for a child's education, Black parents are the most likely to have student loans for their own education at 33.2 percent, two and a half times the percentage among white parents with student loans for a child's education, 13.2 percent.

```{r kable5, echo=FALSE}
kable5
```

Table 8 below confirms that parent-held loans shift repayment burdens to many parents who will struggle to repay, particularly Black parents. More than one-third of Black parents with student loans for a child's education said at the time of their survey that they are unable to fully pay their monthly student loan bill, compared to 20-23 percent among other groups. Of parents with their own student loans who do not hold student loans for a child's education, less than 13% expect to be unable to pay their monthly bill in full.

```{r kable23, echo=FALSE}
kable23
```

The figure below shows parents' total savings and investments. Among Black and Hispanic parents, those with student loans for a child's education have more in savings than those without this debt; the inverse is true for white parents and those of other races. Differences in savings across race are strong: 75 percent of Black parents with student loans for a child's education have less than \$100,000 in savings and investments, compared to less than 50 percent among white parents with these loans.

Note that the figure below shows total savings and investments and are not net totals; it does not take into account debts.

```{r gg3, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
gg3
```

Home ownership status reveals similar disparities. Among those with student loans for a child's education, about 9 in 10 white parents own a home, compared to 2 in 3 Black parents and 8 in 10 Hispanic parents or those of another race.

```{r kable13, echo=FALSE}
kable13
```

The figure below shows that Black and Hispanic parents are more likely to have a "Good" or "Excellent" credit score when they hold parent-held loans. However, white parents display higher frequencies of "Good" or "Excellent" scores regardless of whether they hold debt for a child's education.

```{r gg4, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
gg4
```

Table 10 shows how often parents have had to borrow or cash out of their retirement savings accounts. Across the board, parents are more likely to have done so if they hold debt for a child's education. However, this is more common among Black and Hispanic parents.

```{r kable16, echo=FALSE}
kable16
```

Table 11 shows responses to a survey question asking respondents whether they think they could get by without their primary income for three months. Parents with student loans for a child's education responded "Yes" more often than those without this debt, but particularly among parent-borrowers, Black and Hispanic parents responded "Yes" much less often than did white parents, with a gap of nearly 20 percentage points.

```{r kable20, echo=FALSE}
kable20
```

The figure below shows parents' responses to the question, "Think of your parents when they were your age. Would you say you (and your family) are better, the same, or worse off financially than they were?" While differences across race are not very strong, Black parents respond slightly more positively than do white parents.

```{r gg5, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
gg5
```

The figure below shows parents' responses to the question, "Overall, which one of the following best describes how well you are managing financially these days?" While there is some variation by borrower status, white parents report financial comfort and satisfaction more often than parents of color, with the exception of the "Others without SLs" group.

```{r gg6, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
gg6
```

## The role of family

The tables in this section explore some data on the support these borrowers receive from (or give to) their families.

Table 12 shows that parents with student loans for a child's education are often not empty nesters. Very often among parents with these loans, children over 18 live with the parent: this ranges from 46 percent among white parents to 63 percent among Hispanic parents. Meanwhile, the frequency of parents living with their own parents is noticeably higher among parents of color compared to white parents.

```{r kable10, echo=FALSE}
kable10
```

Table 13 speaks to the frequency of adult children providing financial support to parents. Parents with student loans for a child's education receive help from adult children much more often than parents without these loans; bear in mind that the child's age may be a confounding variable here. Among parent-borrowers, Black and Hispanic parents are the most likely to receive this financial support from an adult child, at 51 percent each.

```{r kable18, echo=FALSE}
kable18
```

Table 14 shows what expenses are defrayed when parents receive financial support from outside the home. Among parent-borrowers, student loan bills and other educational expenses are frequently the focus, most often for Hispanic and white parents.

```{r kable28, echo=FALSE}
kable28
```

## Other financial challenges

The tables in this section explore other financial challenges that parents, especially parent-borrowers, face.

Across the board, those with student loans for a child's education are more likely to have outstanding unpaid credit card debt than those without the education-related debt. Nearly 3 in 4 Black parent-borrowers has outstanding unpaid credit card debt, though other groups are not far behind.

```{r kable14, echo=FALSE}
kable14
```

As indicated by the "Most or all of the time" column in Table 16, parent-borrowers are more likely to have ongoing unpaid balances than those without student loans for a child's education. Among those with student loans for a child's education, the rates of carrying an unpaid balance "Some of the time" or "Most of the time" is highest for Black parent-borrowers at 81 percent.

```{r kable15, echo=FALSE}
kable15
```

As one indicator of whether parent-borrowers are struggling with repayment, Table 17 shows how often parents' spending exceeds their incomes. The "More than your income" column shows that about 1 in 4 of all parent-borrowers of color are earning less than they spend, versus about 1 in 6 white parent-borrowers. Rates of spending more than one's income is higher among those with student loans for a child's education.

```{r kable17, echo=FALSE}
kable17
```

As seen in Table 18, the ability to pay all of one's monthly bills is lowest among Black parents, especially those with student loans for a child's education.

```{r kable21, echo=FALSE}
kable21
```
